    x = frameCount % 8 * 32
    
    # All robot master sprites in mega man 2 are 32x32.
    #
    # The original spritesheet had too little space between each quickman,
    # I edited the file and fixed this.
    #
    # The boss intro sprites start at 0,0 and are 32x32 across 8 sprites
    SPRITE_DIMENSIONS = 32
    img = spritesheet.get(x, 0, 32, 32)
    
    s = SPRITE_DIMENSIONS * 8  # s is the side length of a square sprite
    img.resize(s, s)  # let's make it easier to see and debug    
    
    # center the sprite on the canvas using its side length, s
    image(img, width/2 - s/2, height/2 - s/2)
